# vyum-exercise

Ayyo! This take-home exercise is for dope engineers, such as yourself, to show us what you're working with. Have fun with it and do what you feel.

Please keep in mind there is no need to spend more than four hours on this exercise. You can fill us in as to where you were heading and whatnot during the review.

Also, please complete this exercise within two weeks from the date you received the link to this exercise. Do not hesitate to reach out if something comes up or if you have any questions whatsoever. We're flexible and always here to help.

After you're done, or max out your time, send us the link to your project source code. We'll review the submission then setup a meeting to review it with you within a week or so.
